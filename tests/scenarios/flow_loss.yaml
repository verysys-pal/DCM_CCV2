steps:
  - set: { pv: BL:DCM:CRYO:TEMP:SETPOINT, value: 80 }
  - set: { pv: BL:DCM:CRYO:CMD:MAIN, value: 1 }   # START
  - wait: { pv: BL:DCM:CRYO:STATE:MAIN, equals: 3, timeout: 600 }  # RUN
  # NOTE: Placeholder: In a real setup, flow PV would drop to 0 and alarm triggers.
  # Here we just assert temperature is not ambient, meaning cooling active.
  - assert: { pv: BL:DCM:CRYO:TEMP:T5, max: 200 }
